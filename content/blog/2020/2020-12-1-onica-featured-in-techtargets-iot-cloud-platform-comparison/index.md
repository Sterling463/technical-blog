On April 30, 2019 Onica’s CTO, Tolga Tarhan, was featured in TechTarget’s IoT platform
comparison article. This piece was a deep dive into today's IoT platform market
and a comparison of the capabilities of the top three cloud providers: Amazon Web Services (AWS),
Microsoft Azure, and Google. It also compares Cloud vs. industrial IoT.

In the article, [AWS vs. Azure and Google: An IoT Cloud Platform Comparison](https://searchaws.techtarget.com/feature/AWS-vs-Azure-and-Google-An-IoT-cloud-platform-comparison),
Alan R. Earls reviews the similarities and differences between the cloud providers’ IoT services.
He provides an overview of what’s
available from the major providers and discusses how the vendors’ IoT platforms differ,
allowing readers to weigh their options when it comes to cloud vs. industrial IoT.

“As far as AWS goes, the platform offers good fundamentals that provide the building
blocks for scalable, reliable, and secure IoT applications,” said Tolga Tarhan,
CTO at Onica, an AWS Partner Network (APN) Premier Consulting Partner
and AWS IoT Competency partner. “Developers can let the AWS IoT platform handle
the heavy lifting and focus on making their application or feature unique.”

Rather than compete directly with the hyperscale
cloud providers to build a global network of data centers, the major players in
the Industrial IoT space have instead opted to run their platforms on top of the major public clouds.
