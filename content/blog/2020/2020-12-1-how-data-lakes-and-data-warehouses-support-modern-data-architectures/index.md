Now more than ever, businesses need to leverage data, not only to stay relevant
in a highly competitive landscape but also to find new competitive edges.
In order to solve data problems, businesses need to collect both application
data from multiple systems within their operation and data that is made available
to them by their business partners.

Managing such data becomes increasingly challenging as the volume of information grows,
which is occurring at an ever-increasing pace. This is where data lakes and data warehouses
come into play. To leverage these data-storage structures effectively, it’s important to
understand the difference between them. However, it’s also important to be aware that the
discussion is not about choosing between “data lakes vs. data warehouses,” but rather
about when and how these two important types of data-storage systems can be used together.
