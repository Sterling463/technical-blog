The adoption of hybrid technologies continues to boom. Businesses with legacy systems
look to the cloud to take advantage of powerful benefits that enable them to drive
growth, foster innovation, and enhance the customer experience. Recent studies
indicate that almost 95% of all enterprises are adopting some form of public cloud.
87% of these companies have a hybrid cloud approach as part of their strategy.
While enterprises are clearly ready to embrace the cloud, many remain
grounded in the reality that certain workloads need to be on-premise
for the foreseeable future.

As organizations continue to grapple with their hybrid strategy,
Amazon Web Services&reg; (AWS) Outposts has emerged as a powerful hybrid enabler that can
seamlessly extend your AWS footprint from on-premises to the cloud.
While the typical complex hybrid approach often forces organizations
to prioritize compatibility at the expense of leveraging
the full potential of native cloud capabilities, AWS Outposts
unlocks the power of the AWS-powered platform, regardless of
location, for a truly consistent hybrid experience.
We call this approach *Hybrid 2.0*, and it’s powered by AWS Outposts.

### Redefining hybrid with AWS Outposts

As public cloud adoption has evolved, so have the
[approaches used for hybrid deployments](https://onica.com/videos/implementing-hybrid-cloud-architectures-with-aws/).
One of the most interesting developments in recent years is the global
introduction of AWS Outposts at the tail end of 2018.

[AWS Outposts](https://onica.com/amazon-web-services/aws-outposts/)
is a fully managed service that extends
the AWS platform into virtually any data-center location by using a
pre-built, pre-configured, consistent, and evolving hardware
solution that seamlessly integrates into the global AWS footprint.
AWS Outposts provides the same hardware platform, APIs, tooling,
and services to your on-premises and cloud systems for a
consistent hybrid experience.

This approach avoids past agnosticism to offer the benefits of a
single cloud-native AWS-powered platform to customers that need to
remain on-premises due to latency, data sovereignty, or other legacy
requirements. Sometimes, customers might also choose to leverage
AWS Outposts as a stepping stone to the cloud when their infrastructure
is too complex and tightly woven to justify fracturing it. AWS
Outposts can give customers the opportunity to understand how
to operate and maintain things in the cloud before going *all in*.

### Cloud-native anywhere

Hybrid computing strategies previously focused on crafting complex,
on-premise solutions to give the elasticity of the public cloud
while also being compatible with ever-changing public cloud platforms.
This often reduced technology platforms to the least-common-denominator
to ensure robust compatibility, making the costly tradeoff to forgo the adoption
of modern, cloud-native technologies. For this reason, nearly 71% of enterprise
applications still remain on-premise, often without any cloud-focused modernization opportunities.

AWS Outposts addresses these challenges head-on by redefining hybrid
computing through a modern, cloud-native lens. Customers can now develop
and deploy in the AWS cloud or on-premises without having to rewrite applications.
With AWS Outposts, you have the same hardware and software infrastructure and a
consistent set of services and tools across your AWS cloud and on-premises
environments to build and run modern, cloud-native applications anywhere.

### What’s next?

As cloud ecosystems welcome a new wave of modern hybrid approaches,
you now have the option to build portable, automated, cloud-native
solutions on-premises while getting used to new programming and management
models, then move the infrastructure when you’re ready. If you’re interested
in adopting AWS Outposts, it’s important to not only consider the requirements
for implementation but also how AWS Outposts will fit into your larger
cloud migration journey.
